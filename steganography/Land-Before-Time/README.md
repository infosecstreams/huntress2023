This challenge, as the description hints, requires the use of an esoteric tool called [iSteg (link)](https://github.com/rafiibrahim8/iSteg). Never heard of it but whatever the told us what to use so can't complain too much. Download the tool and run it on the image and you'll quickly find the flag.
