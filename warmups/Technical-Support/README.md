## Description

Author: @JohnHammondWant to join the party of GIFs, memes and emoji shenanigans? Or just want to ask a question for technical support regarding any challenges in the CTF? This CTF uses support tickets to help handle requests. If you need assistance, please create a ticket with the `#ctf-open-ticket` channel. You do not need to direct message any CTF organizers or facilitators, they will just tell you to open a ticket. You might find a flag in the ticket channel, though! Connect here: Join the Discord!
