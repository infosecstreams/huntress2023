They say you aren't supposed to judge a book by its cover, but this is one of my favorites! Download the file below.

The challenge `Book By It's Cover` hint at us to never judge a book by it's cover. Same in cyber.

Let's use the `file` command to see what the file the gave us really is...

```bash
$ file book.rar
book.rar: PNG image data, 800 x 200, 8-bit/color RGB, non-interlaced
```

Ah, an image! Let's open it in an image viewer for our flag:
