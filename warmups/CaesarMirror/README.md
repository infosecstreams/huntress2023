## Description

Author: @JohnHammondCaesar caesar, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?  Perhaps a clever ROT13?  NOTE: this flag does not follow the usual MD5 hash standard flag format. It is still wrapped with the code>flag{}` prefix and suffix.  Download the file(s) below.

## Writeup

We're given a large block of text. The right side is reversed. The left side is caesar ciphered.

Let's fix the left first.

And now the left side needs to be mirrored first:

then caesar unciphered:

Now smash them together and parse out the flag bits.

Get the flag by piecing it together:

`flag{julius_in_a_reflection}`
