JoseMonkey hasn't found me - can you?

Notes:

- bounty does not apply to this since it's a community effort. 

- when you find the city and state, use the MD5 hash of the city followed by a comma, a space, and the two digit state code (caps) to generate the contents of the flag{}... so for example, if I was in Atlanta, you would hash "Atlanta, GA" which is 1a5c4934d62f884b3a25429d6c54fa5d and translates to flag{1a5c4934d62f884b3a25429d6c54fa5d}
