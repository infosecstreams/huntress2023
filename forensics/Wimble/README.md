## Writeup

This was a re-used challenge from Nahamcon called 'fetch'. Even the flag was re-used so this challenge was disappointing.

Anyway, the way it's supposed to be done is using PECmd.exe to find some interesting metadata that contains the `flag{...}` string.

Using PECmd.exe you can decompress all the *.pf files or you can just decompress and analyze the WORDPAD pf file and find the flag.

`flag{97f33c9783c21df85d79d613b0b258bd}`
