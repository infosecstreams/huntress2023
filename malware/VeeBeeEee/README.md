## Description

Author: @JohnHammond

While investigating a host, we found this strange file attached to a scheduled task.  It was invoked with `wscript` or something... can you find a flag?   NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.   Download the file(s) below.

## Writeup

This was an "encoded" VBScript. [Mr. Hammond helpfully provides a tool in his GitHub repos](https://github.com/JohnHammond/vbe-decoder/blob/c9ce83ba2ef2a73d981964b1297a16b408757efb/vbe-decoder.py).

Once you've got the script decoded you'll quickly find the flag linked on a [pastebin site](https://pastebin.com/raw/SiYGwwcz).

`flag{ed81d24958127a2adccfb343012cebff}`
