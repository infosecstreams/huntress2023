## Description

Author: @JohnHammond

I was arguing with a co-worker on whether or not it is "Remote Access Tool" or "Remote Access Trojan",  and he didn't agree with me, so I sent him this shady file ;) NOTE: Archive password: `infected`  NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.
