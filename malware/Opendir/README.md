## Writeup

We're given a webserver with directory browsing enabled. Downloaded the entire site with `wget` and then `grep`'ed for the flag:

```shell
$ wget --user opendir --password opendir --recursive --no-parent http://chal.ctf.games:31556
[...]
$ rg 'flag' *
[...]
chal.ctf.games:31556/sir/64_bit_new/oui.txt
86327:flag{9eb4ebf423b4e5b2a88aa92b0578cbd9}
```

`flag{9eb4ebf423b4e5b2a88aa92b0578cbd9}`
